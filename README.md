# DL-END-TO-END

Welcome to the DL-END-TO-END repository, where we focus on providing end-to-end deep learning solutions. This repository will be continuously updated with code and notebooks that apply deep learning models to solve real-world problems.

## Current Projects

- **Breast Cancer Detection with TensorFlow**: `Breast_cancer_tensorflow.ipynb` is a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to use TensorFlow to build a model for detecting breast cancer from biopsy data.
- **Breast Cancer Prediction with PyTorch**: `cancer-prediction/breast_cancer_pytorch.ipynb` showcases a PyTorch implementation for predicting breast cancer using neural networks.
- **CIFAR-10 Image Dataset**: `CIFAR-10-Dataset/CIFAR10.ipynb` is a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to use TensorFlow to build a model for classifying different image classes.
- **Face Mask Detection**: `face_mask_detection/face_mask_detection.ipynb` is a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to use deep learning to detect whether individuals in images are wearing face masks.
- **IMDB-Review**: `imdb-review\imdb_review.ipynb` is a jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to use Tensorflow to build a model for classifying negative and positive on imdb ratings.
